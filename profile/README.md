# Scrum Guide Extensions

Welcome to the official GitHub organisation for community-driven **extensions to the Scrum Guide**.

Scrum, as defined in the [2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org), remains intentionally minimal. Its purpose is to provide the bare essentials of a framework that enables inspection, adaptation, and delivery of value. But as the world of product development evolves, many teams need **additional guidance** to apply Scrum effectively in their specific contexts.

This organisation exists to provide that guidance—**without redefining Scrum**.

## Purpose

This is a place to:

- Clarify intent without changing the rules.
- Explore applications of Scrum in modern, complex environments.
- Share optional, community-reviewed extensions for specific needs like:
  - Scaling
  - Working with AI
  - Integrating DevOps practices
  - Product strategy and value measurement

## What These Extensions Are

- ✅ Optional and modular
- ✅ Grounded in the ethos of the Scrum Guide
- ✅ Focused on improving outcomes, not adding bureaucracy
- ✅ Developed and reviewed by experienced Scrum practitioners

## What These Extensions Are Not

- ❌ Changes to the core Scrum Guide
- ❌ A replacement for professional judgment
- ❌ A formal standard

## Projects

Each repository in this organisation focuses on a specific theme, practice area, or context. Browse through them to find guidance relevant to your situation.

## Contributing

We welcome experienced contributors who are committed to keeping Scrum lightweight, powerful, and grounded in empirical process control.

To propose an extension:

1. Fork the relevant repository or create a new one under discussion.
2. Follow the contribution guidelines within each repo.
3. Use clear language, keep it short, and avoid creating new rules.

Scrum works best when it’s understood deeply and applied thoughtfully. These extensions are here to help you do just that.
